1. When angry, count to 10 before you speak. If very angry, a hundred. — Thomas Jefferson.

2. When reviewing code, count to 10 before you refactor a line. If the code does not have tests, a hundred. — Samer Buna

3. There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. — Phil Karlton

4. Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. — Bill Gates

5. There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. — C.A.R. Hoare

6. Do not be attached to code because of how much effort you put into it. Bad code needs to be discarded.

7. The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you’re doing. — Bret Victor

8. Knowing how to program does not make you a software engineer.

9. The act of programming, in its simplest definition, is giving computers instructions to do something with some input in order to produce some output.
   
    The act of engineering software is about designing, writing, testing, and maintaining computer programs with the purpose of solving problems for many users. It is about creating robust and safe solutions that will withstand the test of time and will work for some of the unknown problems around the original obvious ones.
    
    Software engineers understand everything about the problems they solve, the solutions they provide, the limitations of those solutions, their privacy implications, and their security implications.
   
    If someone does not understand the problem, they should not be allowed to program a solution for it.

11. “Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them. “ — Albert Einstein

12. Before writing a program, a software engineer asks the questions:
    
      * What problems am I trying to solve?
    
      * What else besides writing code can be done to solve them?
    
      * What can I do to make these problems easier to solve with code?
   
13. “I didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.“ — Mark Twain

14. Build what the world needs — not just what you wish you had. Too often, technologists live rarefied lives and focus on products catering to their own specific needs. Seek opportunities to broaden your life experience, which will give you better visibility into what the world needs.

15. Productivity boils down to high-velocity decision-making and a bias for action. This requires a) good intuition, which comes from experience, so as to make generally correct decisions given partial information, b) a keen awareness of when to move more carefully and wait for more information, because the cost of an incorrect decision would be greater than cost of the delay. The optimal velocity/quality decision-making tradeoff can vary greatly in different environments.

16. Making decisions faster means you make more decisions over the course of your career, which will give you stronger intuition about the correctness of available options. Experience is key to productivity, and greater productivity will provide you with more experience: a virtuous cycle.


17. "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise." - Edsger W. Dijkstra


18. "A proper abstraction decouples the code so that every change doesn’t echo throughout the entire code base." - Ronna Steinburg


19. "A good API is not just easy to use but also hard to misuse." - JBD


20. "Computing is all about abstractions. Those below yours are just details. Those above yours are limiting complicated crazy town." - Joe Beda


21.  In situations where you are aware that your intuition is lacking, adhere to abstract principles. Build up lists of tried-and-true principles throughout your career: principles are formalized intuition, that generalize to a broader range of situations than raw pattern recognition (which requires direct and extensive experience of similar situations).


22.  Solve problems. Charge for the solution. Scale through technology.
